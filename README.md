# DevTinder – Match & Collaborate with Developers 👩‍💻❤️👨‍💻

[🔥DevTinder](https://devtinder-chi.vercel.app/) is a developer networking platform where tech enthusiasts can **connect and chat** based on mutual interests.
Inspired by **Tinder**, but built for **developers**, DevTinder helps you discover like-minded coders and potential collaborators.

💡 _Find your next co-founder, hackathon teammate, or coding buddy!_
DevTinder lets developers **discover, match, and chat in real-time** — because great projects start with the right connections.

- ⚙️ **Backend (Node.js + Express + MongoDB + Socket.IO)** → [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/work-saddam/devTinder)

## 🔥 Features
